# Project Proposal  
## A Prototype of an AI-Based English Vocabulary Learning Assistant for Young Learners  
*(Individual Project)*

## 1. Problem Formulation & User Need

In Singapore, English is the primary language used in education, professional environments, and daily communication. As a result, developing strong English vocabulary skills from an early age is critical for children’s academic success and long-term communication ability. However, many young learners aged 5–9 face difficulties in consistently practising and expanding their English vocabulary outside the classroom.

One key challenge is limited parental availability. Many parents have demanding work schedules and are unable to dedicate regular time to structured vocabulary or reading practice with their children. Additionally, not all parents are confident in their own English proficiency, which can further limit their ability to effectively guide vocabulary learning even when time is available.

While professional English tuition and enrichment programmes exist, these services are often expensive and not accessible to all families. This creates unequal access to quality language learning support, particularly for less-fortunate households. Existing learning resources such as worksheets or basic vocabulary applications tend to be static, rely on fixed content, and lack adaptive guidance to support independent learning.

This individual project aims to address these challenges by developing a **prototype AI-based English vocabulary learning assistant** that supports independent learning for young learners. To ensure feasibility within the project timeline, the initial phase focuses specifically on vocabulary learning, providing structured practice and basic AI-generated guidance.

## 2. Method & Generative AI Service Justification

This project adopts a **text-based Generative AI approach** to support vocabulary learning in a flexible and scalable manner. Compared to traditional rule-based or static learning tools, Generative AI enables dynamic generation of learning content and explanations.

### Text Modality (Core)
A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is used to generate:
- Vocabulary practice items  
- Simple usage examples  
- Basic explanations to support understanding and recall  

Instead of relying solely on predefined vocabulary content, the LLM dynamically produces age-appropriate guidance that adapts to the selected vocabulary set.

### Bounded Use of Generative AI
The role of Generative AI in this project is intentionally constrained. The system focuses only on:
- Vocabulary-level content generation  
- Simple explanations and examples  

Advanced personalisation, learner profiling, or behavioural modelling are intentionally excluded to maintain scope control and project feasibility.

### Selected Generative AI Service
**Gemini (school-provided)** is selected as the primary Generative AI service due to:
- Strong text generation capabilities  
- Scalability for web-based deployment  
- Availability at no additional cost to the project  

This makes Gemini a suitable and practical choice for an academic prototype.

## 3. Integration, Features & User Interaction Flow

### Project Scope (Phase 1 – Core Implementation)

The scope of this phase includes:
- A web-based prototype with a simple and child-friendly interface  
- Vocabulary-focused practice using text input  
- LLM-based generation of vocabulary guidance and usage examples  
- A default primary-level vocabulary set  
- Optional parent-defined vocabulary input  

### Core Features

- **Vocabulary Selection**  
  Parents can choose from a default vocabulary list or provide a custom list of words. Custom input may be provided by typing, pasting text, or uploading a simple CSV file.

- **Vocabulary Practice**  
  Children practise vocabulary through text-based exercises generated by the LLM.

- **AI-Generated Guidance**  
  The system provides simple explanations or usage examples to support understanding and
