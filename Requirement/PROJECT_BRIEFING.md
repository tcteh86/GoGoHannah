## ITI123 – Generative AI & Deep Learning Project (2025S2)

This document outlines the project structure, assessment stages, deliverables, and evaluation criteria for the ITI123 Generative AI & Deep Learning course project.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project is assessed across **four stages**, covering proposal, development, deployment, and presentation.  
Students are expected to design, build, evaluate, and deploy a **Generative AI–powered application** that solves a clearly defined user or business problem.

---

## 🧩 Assessment Structure

| Stage | Component | Weight |
|------|----------|--------|
| Stage 1 | Project Proposal | 20 Marks |
| Stage 2 | Milestone Report | 35 Marks |
| Stage 3 | Final Report & Deployment | 35 Marks |
| Stage 4 | Final Presentation (Individual) | 10 Marks |
| **Total** |  | **100 Marks** |

---

## 🚀 Stage 1: Project Proposal (20 Marks)

### Objective
Research and define a development plan around a **clearly identified problem**, suitable **Generative AI services**, integration scope, and expected outcomes.

> ⚠️ Note: Costs incurred from external AI services will **not be reimbursed**, except for school-provided services (e.g. Gemini).

### Proposal Requirements

#### 1. Problem Formulation
- Clearly define the problem area
- Identify specific user needs
- Explain why this problem is meaningful and worth solving

#### 2. Method & AI Services
- Identify the Generative AI service(s) or model(s) to be used
- Justify the selection based on:
  - Capability
  - Scalability
  - Deployment considerations
  - Cost and accessibility

#### 3. Integration & Features
- Define the scope of system integration
- Describe application features powered by GenAI
- Explain user interaction flow and expected outcomes

#### 4. Evaluation Plan
- Define how success and effectiveness will be measured
- Use clear, measurable, and goal-aligned metrics

### Marking Criteria (20 Marks)

| Criterion | Marks |
|--------|------|
| Problem Formulation & User Needs | 5 |
| Method & AI Service Justification | 5 |
| Integration, Features & User Flow | 5 |
| Evaluation Plan | 5 |

## 🛠 Stage 2: Milestone Report (35 Marks)

### Objective
Demonstrate **tangible development progress** and validate design decisions through early implementation.

The milestone report serves as an **early draft of the final report** and is primarily intended for **mentor feedback**.

### Constraints
- Maximum **8 pages** (excluding references)
- Focus on **application**, not GenAI theory
- Screenshots or short demo videos (≤10 minutes) are encouraged

### Required Sections

#### 1. Motivation
- Restate the problem
- Clarify specific user needs being addressed

#### 2. Application Development
- AI services/models used and justification
- Technical architecture (data, tools, frameworks)
- Integration approach and results
- Completed and planned feature design
- Observed risks and mitigation strategies
- Next steps and development roadmap

### Expectations
- Working **operational prototype**
- Evidence of **active risk mitigation**
  - Prompt constraints
  - Input filtering
  - Guardrails and safety controls

### Marking Criteria (35 Marks)

| Criterion | Marks |
|--------|------|
| Problem & Service Validation | 7 |
| Methodology & Integration Progress | 7 |
| Feature Design & Preliminary Results | 7 |
| Responsible AI & Risk Mitigation | 7 |
| Plan, Cost Awareness & Report Quality | 7 |

---

## 📊 Stage 3: Final Report & Deployment (35 Marks)

### Objective
Deliver a **complete, deployed, and well-evaluated Generative AI application**.

### Report Requirements
- Maximum **15 pages** (excluding references)
- Detailed documentation of:
  - GenAI service usage
  - System architecture
  - Design decisions
  - Evaluation results
  - Deployment strategy

### Deployment
- Application must be deployed on a suitable target platform
  - Web application
  - Mobile app
  - IoT system
  - Robot / embedded system
- Deployment should be robust, accessible, and reproducible

### Code Submission
- GitHub / GitLab repository preferred
- Alternatively, a ZIP file ≤ 5MB
- Include:
  - Clean, organized code
  - Clear README and file descriptions
  - Evidence of source control and configuration management

### Marking Criteria (35 Marks)

| Criterion | Marks |
|--------|------|
| Originality & Completeness | 10 |
| Application Effectiveness & Evaluation | 5 |
| Code Quality & Documentation | 5 |
| Deployment & Accessibility | 10 |
| Report Quality | 5 |

---

## 🎤 Stage 4: Final Presentation (Individual) (10 Marks)

### Objective
Demonstrate **individual contribution**, technical understanding, and confidence in explaining the system.

### Assessment Focus
- Clear, structured, and engaging presentation
- Smooth demonstration of application and deployment
- Strong understanding of methodologies and results
- Ability to answer questions independently and confidently

---

## 📎 Deliverables Summary

- **Stage 1:** Project Proposal document
- **Stage 2:** Milestone Report + optional demo video
- **Stage 3:** Final Report + deployed application + code repository
- **Stage 4:** Individual presentation

---

## ✅ Notes
- This project emphasizes **practical integration**, not theoretical discussion
- Clear problem framing, disciplined engineering, and responsible AI design are critical
- Reusability, deployment readiness, and evaluation rigor are key success factors
